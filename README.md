# Car game
## Idea
- movement WSAD with rotation. W means going straight in front of the car
- Acceleration and deceleration
- top speed for each car
- tile map from file: asphalt, grass, start/meta, checkpoints(so you cant cheese start/meta)
  - Asphalt - normal speed
  - Grass - lower acceleration/smaller top speed
  - Walls - block movement 
- lap timer
- speed counter with moving line (analog live speed)
